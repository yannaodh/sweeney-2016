Python with numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) will need to be installed. 
IPython Notebook (http://ipython.org/notebook.html) will be required in order to interact with the IPython Notebooks which launch the simulations and create the figures.

Functions for running simulations of receptive field development in a feedforward network with diffusive BCM are contained in ff_network_functions_spatial_clean.py. Receptive_field_formation_dBCM.ipynb is an IPython notebook which runs a simulation and produces Figure 5C,E from the paper.
